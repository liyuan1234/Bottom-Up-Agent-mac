Objectives:
- Analyze the recent UI-level operations you performed.

Inputs:
1. A list of UI-level operations: '{operations}'
2. Screenshots of the game captured during these operations.

Instructions:
1. Determine which UI elements were interacted with, based on the coordinates provided.
2. Analyze how the game screen changed during the operations.
3. Give this sequence of operations a meaningful **name** and a **description** that includes:
   - What the operation does (its function)
   - Any precautions to take
4. The name must be highly relevant to the actual operations performed.
5. If the operations are **meaningless**, use the `no_meaning_skill` tool to report it.
6. If the operations are **meaningful**, use the `save_skill` tool to save the result.
7. Think step by step before making a decision.

Context:

Your Role:
- Help me discover new and useful operations.
- Avoid repeating actions I've already learned.
- Guide me toward the most effective interaction, based on the current game state.

Instructions:
1. Analyze the screenshot to understand the current game state.
2. Choose the most appropriate interaction point from the list of potential interact points.
3. Your guidance should **not** duplicate any of the existing actions.
4. Use the tool `give_guidance` to provide your recommendation.

Objectives:

Inputs:
1. A list of learned skills.

Skills:

Instructions:
1. Analyze the screenshot to understand the current state of the game.
2. For each skill, assess:
   - Whether the **execution conditions are currently satisfied**.
   - Whether it is functionally suitable for current state.
3. **First, eliminate any skills that are not currently executable.**
4. Then, among the remaining executable skills, choose the one most appropriate.
5. Must return your selection using the function tool provided — do NOT respond with text.

def skill_evaluate_prompt(task, skill_info):

Task:

Inputs:
1. **Action Information**  
   Name and description of the action:  
   {skill_info}

2. **Screenshots**  
   A pair of images showing the game state **before** and **after** the action.

Instructions:

Step 1: **Expected Change**  
- Based on the action description, summarize what is expected to change in the game state if the action works as intended.

Step 2: **Actual Change**  
- Analyze the differences between the before and after screenshots.
- Describe all **observable UI changes** (e.g., elements, values, progress bars, icons).

Step 3: **Consistency Check → `is_consistent`**  
- If the actual changes match the expected outcome (in type and magnitude), set `is_consistent = true`; otherwise, `false`.

Step 4: **Progress Indicators**  
- Identify at least **three concrete, task-relevant indicators** that suggest progress toward the task goal.

Step 5: **Progress Check → `is_progressive`**  
- Evaluate whether any of the indicators were clearly met.
  - If **any** indicator is met meaningfully, set `is_progressive = true`.
  - If **none** are met, or if changes are negligible/irrelevant, set `is_progressive = false`.
  - If the action is **only preparatory** (e.g., hovering, previewing, selecting without effect), set `is_progressive = false`.

Step 6: **Default to False**  
- If information is incomplete, unclear, or ambiguous, default both booleans to `false`.

Remember:
→ Do not guess.
→ Only return the `action_reflex` function call with the evaluated booleans.

• Do **not** group skills that express **different functions or intentions**, even if they appear related.  
• Think of this as merging duplicates or near-duplicates, not broad semantic clustering.  

Output must strictly call the function “cluster_skills” with no extra text.

Please:  
1. Identify cluster of **functionally equivalent** skills.

3. List its members as an array of action ids.
